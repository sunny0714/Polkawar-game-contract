# Hardhat Polka War Game Contract(version 3)

This project is intended to be used with the
[Hardhat Beginners Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial)

```sh
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

> Note: There's [an issue in `ganache-core`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues/650) that can make the `npm install` step fail. 
>
> If you see `npm ERR! code ENOLOCAL`, try running `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.

**Happy _buidling_!**
